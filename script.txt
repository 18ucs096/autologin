	 It allows you to login to websites without clicking
	 
		how did it do that
			for the first time when you logging in , On typing password , Just see the icon on top right
			
				could you see it 
			
			Now click on it to save your credentials
			
			Fine now , you are done , From next time onwards , whenever you go to the site Autologin will do the typing and clicking work for you
			
			============= show the demo
			
			
		
		WHat ABout security
		
				Set a Master password via going to options and set  master password
				
				Close the browser and re-open 
				
				Goto the web page 
				
		
		What is Basic Authentication
				 basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent to provide a user name and password when making a request.
				 
					If you could goto this web page , You will be prompted with username & password

Hi,   

  I am sure your would be using Aws dynamodbclient for android  in order to make request with dynamo db. 
  
  The client was just a wrapper part , Underneath , its a plain REST call with encrypted AWS credentials
  
  for more info have a look into the source (https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/master/aws-java-sdk-dynamodb/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/AmazonDynamoDBClient.java) This in turn will transform your request as specified in (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTable.html)
	
		Hope it answers , what is underneath , rather how it appears
		
Thanks
